## Usage with Expo Go App

Expo Client enables you to work with all of the [Components and APIs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) in `react-native`, as well as the [JavaScript APIs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest) that the are bundled with the Expo App.

Expo Client supports running any project that doesn't have custom native modules added.

- Download the "Expo Go" app from the Play Store or App Store.
- Start your project with Expo
  - Install the CLI `npm i -g expo-cli`
  - Start the project `npx expo start`
- Open the project:
  - Sign in to expo and the project will appear in the app.
  - Or point your phone's camera at the QR code in the terminal (press "c" to view it).
